To run the project you need to follow the installation process below if you don't have the React Native environment.

## Installing Expo CLI

Get Started

```
npm install -g expo-cli

or

yarn global add expo-cli
```

> You can get more details about installation here.(https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/#checking-cli-version)

### Requirements
- [Node.js LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install#buildinstall) for macOS users

### Installing dependences 

```
expo install
```

## Starting the development server

```
expo start
```
When you run expo start (or npm start), Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of our app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app. It also pops up Expo Dev Tools, a graphical interface for Expo CLI.
